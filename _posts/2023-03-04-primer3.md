title: PS5 Beta Introduces Discord Voice Chat, VRR support for 1440p, and more
---

Since the launch of PlayStation 5 just over two years ago, we’ve introduced incredible games like God of War Ragnarök, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, Gran Turismo 7, Horizon Forbidden West and Returnal, which showcase the boundless creativity of our development community and the extraordinary experiences they’ve been able to build on our platform.

      <h2 class="mt-2 overflow-y-auto">Join a Discord Voice Chat on Your PS5 Console. You can now join
        Discord voice chats on your PS5 console and easily chat with friends on
        most other gaming platforms. To start, link your Discord and PlayStation
        Network accounts from your PS5 console following these steps*. Then, use
        the Discord app on your mobile device or computer to get a Discord voice
        chat going on your PS5 console (make sure your Discord app is updated to
        the latest version). You can also let your Discord friends see when
        you’re online and what you’re playing.
        Note: if you’ve linked your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in
        the past to display what game you’re playing, you’ll need to link your
        accounts again on your PS5 console to grant the new permissions needed
        for Discord voice chat.</h2>
