short_description: "At nDreams we’ve been pioneering the possibilities of VR
  gaming for the past decade and we’re always looking to push the medium, such
  as with Fracked’s fluid, run and gun action gameplay on PS VRWe wanted to push
  things even further with our first next-gen VR title on the PS VR2, in a way
  never seen before. "
description: We were proud of the reception of Fracked’s run and cover gunplay
  when it launched on the PS VR back in 2021 – it was fast, visceral and
  uncompromised, but also entirely accessible and intuitive.  We were wrapping
  up the game just as we were starting work with the PS VR2, and we knew this
  was the perfect foundation to build upon with Synapse.  Our new game evolves
  this core gameplay, making full use of the Sense controller’s analogue sticks,
  adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, but we wanted to go beyond this.
